write a add function for this functionality
let x = add(1)
x = x(2)
x = x(3)
x.result() // 6
x = x(4)
x.result() // 10

print element one by one after 5 second
let arr = [3,4,5,67,8,2,1,]






write a function that sort array according  to occurrence. 
let arr = [1,2,3,4,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,7]
output:=  [7,7,7,7,3,3,3,2,2,1,4,6]
